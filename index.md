# Felix Nguyen's Portfolio

Hello. My name is Felix Nguyen and I am a student at Cal State Fullerton and my major is computer science.

## Favorite 120L Labs

My GitHub page is http://github.com/your_username.

Lab 4, part 2
This lab was interesting as we needed to write code to guess a secret number in order to finish the part. I really liked the game aspect of it so the process for the coding part was fun in my opinion. This part took me a while to finish but eventually I was able to get through it. 

Lab 6, part 2
This lab, I learned how blackjack was programmed in code. Iâ€™ve always liked blackjack so it was definitely a cool lab to do. The end result was fun as I got to play blackjack as an end result.

Lab 7, part 1
This lab was interesting as we need to create arguments to store the inputs for the dates. This one would be particularly challenging. I had to figure out how to correctly store everything for the code to work.
